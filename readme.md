## State of Mind

- Overall, I decided to use Goyave because I like the way it is built and its integration with PostgreSQL through native GORM. I think it's super pertinent ;)
    - I had never used it before starting the test. I did a little research and discovered it.
    - So, I encountered a bit of a learning curve, but it was cool and stimulating for my brain.
    - I could promote the framework a lot, though!

- I switched from basic auth to JWT because it allows me to recognize the owner of any resource.
    - If we want to build a good product with a long-term vision, this is the way to go.
    - I hope you'll see the benefits :)

## Running (2 Terminals for better readability)
**I automatized everything but there is some output defaults so it's easier to just trigger it manually)

### Terminal 1
- sudo make all (run postgres, migrate, boot api)

## Quick Further Optimization
- Check balance before creating an order (I started, but I'm running out of time, so I just stuck to the initial subject)
- Go client to query the API
- GET `/assets` and `/orders` should return only owner data, similar to PATCH & DELETE
- ...


## Outro
- I hope you like it. I enjoyed working on it, spending a few hours here and there over the course of a week.
- I believe it's a great implementation to start building a robust system.
- I could have opted for a simpler micro-framework like `Echo` with `sqlx` and RAW SQL, but I wanted to try something different. I found Goyave to be very pertinent and recent, especially with its file segmentation features, making it more maintainable for a long-term product.
- Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
