## state-of-mind
- Overall i decided to use goyave because i like the way of building with it and it's integration with postgresql with native GORM i think it's super pertinent ;)
    - I never used it before starting the test i did a lil research and found it
    - So i've added some learning curve but that was cool and stimulated my brain

- I switched basic auth to JWT because it's allowing me to recognize the owner of any ressources
    - If we want to build a good product with a long therm vision that's the way
    - It's not productive to build something with basicAuth in this case because i can't recognise user directly, i'm doing it with JWT
    - Hope you'll see the benefits :)
